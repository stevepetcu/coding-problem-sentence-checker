# Daily Coding Problem: Sentence Checker [Medium]

This problem was asked by Nest.

## Definition
Create a basic sentence checker that takes in a stream of characters and determines whether they form valid sentences. If a sentence is valid, the program should print it out.

We can consider a sentence valid if it conforms to the following rules:

1. The sentence must start with a **capital letter**, followed by a **lowercase letter**, or a **space**.
1. All other characters must be **lowercase letters**, **separators** (`,`,`;`,`:`), or **terminal marks (`.`,`?`,`!`).
1. There must be a **single space** between each **word**.
1. The sentence must end with a **terminal mark** immediately **following a word**.
